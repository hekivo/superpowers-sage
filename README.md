# Superpowers Sage

Agent plugin for modern WordPress development with the **Roots ecosystem** — works with **Claude Code**, **VS Code (GitHub Copilot)**, **Cursor**, **OpenAI Codex**, and any AI assistant that supports the agent plugin format. Workflow skills, design tool integration, visual verification, content modeling, and zero-token automation hooks for **Sage**, **Acorn**, and **Lando** projects.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| [Lando](https://lando.dev) | 3.x |
| [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) + [Acorn](https://roots.io/acorn/) | 11+ / 4+ |
| PHP | 8.2+ |
| Node.js | 20+ |

## Installation

> **One repository, four loaders.** The same plugin installs identically regardless of your AI assistant. Pick the section for your tool below.

---

### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add codigodoleo/superpowers-sage
claude plugin install superpowers-sage@superpowers-sage
```

Alternatively, install directly from the repository URL:

```bash
claude plugin install --source https://github.com/codigodoleo/superpowers-sage
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
claude plugin list
```

---

### VS Code (GitHub Copilot Chat)

1. Enable the preview feature in your settings:

   ```json
   // settings.json
   "chat.plugins.enabled": true
   ```

2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run:

   ```
   Chat: Install Plugin From Source
   ```

3. Enter the repository URL:

   ```
   https://github.com/codigodoleo/superpowers-sage
   ```

**Alternative — install via Extensions view:**  
Search `@agentPlugins` in the Extensions sidebar, or add the repository as a marketplace source in your settings:

```json
// settings.json
"chat.plugins.marketplaces": [
  "codigodoleo/superpowers-sage"
]
```

Then search for and install `superpowers-sage` from the Extensions view.

---

### Cursor

> **Note:** We consistently see significantly better results with **Claude CLI + Sonnet**. This plugin was designed around Claude Code's execution model — worktrees, hooks, subagent dispatch, MCP tool routing — and those features are unavailable in Cursor. You get the skill instructions, but none of the automation. If you have access to the Claude CLI, it's worth using that instead.

Recent Cursor versions removed the "paste repo URL" plugin installation UI. The reliable approach is a one-time clone + symlink:

```bash
# Clone once to a shared location
git clone https://github.com/codigodoleo/superpowers-sage ~/.ai-plugins/superpowers-sage

# In each project root, symlink into .cursor/rules/
ln -s ~/.ai-plugins/superpowers-sage/skills .cursor/rules/superpowers-sage-skills
ln -s ~/.ai-plugins/superpowers-sage/agents .cursor/rules/superpowers-sage-agents
```

On **Windows** (Command Prompt as Administrator):

```cmd
mklink /D .cursor\rules\superpowers-sage-skills %USERPROFILE%\.ai-plugins\superpowers-sage\skills
mklink /D .cursor\rules\superpowers-sage-agents %USERPROFILE%\.ai-plugins\superpowers-sage\agents
```

To update: `git -C ~/.ai-plugins/superpowers-sage pull` — all projects pick up changes automatically via the symlinks.

Cursor discovers skills and agents from `.cursor/rules/` automatically. Hooks are loaded from `hooks/cursor-hooks.json`.

---

### OpenAI Codex

The plugin ships with a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest that follows the
[Codex plugin format](https://developers.openai.com/codex/plugins/build).

**Personal install:**

1. Clone or symlink the repository into your Codex plugins directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codigodoleo/superpowers-sage ~/.codex/plugins/superpowers-sage
   ```

2. Register it in your personal marketplace at `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "plugins": [
       { "name": "superpowers-sage", "source": "./superpowers-sage" }
     ]
   }
   ```

**Repo-level install** — drop the same entry into
`$REPO_ROOT/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and clone into
`$REPO_ROOT/plugins/superpowers-sage`.

Codex discovers skills from `skills/`, agents from `agents/`, and lifecycle
hooks from `hooks/hooks.json` (referenced from `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`).

---

### Local / Generic (any compatible assistant)

Clone the repository and register the plugin directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codigodoleo/superpowers-sage ~/.ai-plugins/superpowers-sage
```

Then point your AI assistant to the cloned directory. For tools that support `chat.pluginLocations` (VS Code) or `--plugin-dir` (Claude Code):

```json
// VS Code settings.json
"chat.pluginLocations": {
  "/Users/you/.ai-plugins/superpowers-sage": true
}
```

```bash
# Claude Code — session-scoped
claude --plugin-dir ~/.ai-plugins/superpowers-sage
```

---

### Design Tools (optional)

These MCP integrations unlock the `/designing` and `/verifying` skills. Configure once per machine independent of which AI assistant you use:

`/designing` routes by the URL or path the user provides — `paper.design/*` → Paper MCP, `figma.com/*` → Figma, Stitch host → Stitch, or a local `.pen` path / `design/` folder → Pencil. Paper is the preferred cloud source when available.

```bash
# Paper.design (preferred) — screenshots + computed styles + JSX per section
# See https://paper.design for MCP install instructions

# Stitch (Google) — extract screens and sections from designs
claude mcp add stitch -- npx -y @anthropic/stitch-mcp

# Figma — extract frames and layers from designs
claude mcp add figma -- npx -y figma-developer-mcp --figma-api-key=YOUR_KEY

# Pencil — local .pen file design tool (no URL — routes by file path or design/ folder)
claude mcp add pencil -- npx -y @anthropic/pencil-mcp

# Playwright — capture implementation screenshots for visual verification
claude mcp add playwright -- npx -y @anthropic/playwright-mcp
```

### Design tool routing

| Tool | Trigger | Token source | Structural reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paper | URL `paper.design/*` | `get_computed_styles` | `.reference.jsx` |
| Figma | URL `figma.com/*` | `get_variable_defs` | `get_design_context` |
| Stitch | Stitch host URL | `get_screen` | `get_screen` |
| Pencil | Path `*.pen` or `design/` folder | `get_variables()` | `batch_get` JSON |

### Pencil `.pen` file conventions

```
design/
  ├── design-system.lib.pen   ← global tokens — always read first
  ├── components.lib.pen      ← reusable component masters
  ├── component-map.md        ← generated by pencil-extractor (do not edit)
  └── [page-name].pen         ← one file per site route
```

Rules:
- `*.lib.pen` files are system/library files, never pages
- `*design-system*.lib.pen` has highest priority for token extraction
- `component-map.md` is generated — never edited manually

For VS Code, add MCP servers in `.vscode/mcp.json` or user settings under `"mcp"`.

## Getting Started

After installing, open your Sage project and run:

```
/onboarding
```

This analyzes your project, detects installed packages, design tools, and active plans, then suggests next steps.

> **Plugin-level rules** live in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) at the plugin
> root — universal Roots/Bedrock/Lando/Tailwind v4 constraints that
> apply to every session.

### Which skill do I use?

Quick decision tree for common tasks:

| If you want to... | Run |
|---|---|
| Analyze a new project | `/onboarding` |
| Start a new feature from scratch | `/architecture-discovery` → `/plan-generator` → `/building` |
| Set up design tokens + UI atoms | `/sage-design-system` |
| Build ACF blocks from a plan | `/building` (auto-invokes `/block-scaffolding` per block) |
| Add a single new ACF block outside a plan | `/block-scaffolding` |
| Evolve an existing block (drift, coverage, new variants) | `/block-refactoring` |
| Capture design references from Paper/Figma/Stitch/Pencil | `/designing` |
| Verify implementation matches design | `/verifying` |
| Review code before PR | `/reviewing` |
| Diagnose a Sage/Acorn/Lando issue | `/debugging` |
| Model content (CPT vs ACF vs Options) | `/modeling` |
| Install a WordPress plugin | `/install-plugin` |

Gerund naming means skills describe the **activity**, not the shortcut — if you're "building," you run `/building`.

## Workflow Skills

Skills are **activities** — gerund naming communicates what's happening, not what to type.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/onboarding` | Project analysis: stack, packages, design tools, active plans |
| `/architecture-discovery` | Deep architecture discovery with hard gates, section approvals, and reviewer loop |
| `/plan-generator` | Converts approved architecture spec into executable plan files and dependency graph |
| `/architecting` | Compatibility wrapper: runs architecture-discovery then plan-generator |
| `/modeling` | Content architecture: classify static vs dynamic, recommend Poet/ACF |
| `/designing` | Design tool integration: Paper (preferred), Stitch, Figma, or local asset extraction — routed by URL |
| `/building` | Plan-driven implementation with auto-verification after each component |
| `/verifying` | Visual comparison: screenshots vs design reference |
| `/reviewing` | Convention audit + design alignment check |
| `/debugging` | Sage-aware troubleshooting with cache and OPcache knowledge |
| `/install-plugin` | Install WordPress plugins via Composer from local `.zip` or `wp-packages.org` |

### Recommended flow for new features

```
/architecture-discovery  →  approved architecture spec
/plan-generator          →  plan + assets + content model
/building      →  implement from plan, verify each component
/reviewing     →  convention audit + design alignment
```

For simple tasks, invoke any skill directly.

## Reference Skills

18 deep technical references, used internally by workflow skills and agents:

- **Sage/Lando** — project setup, ACF Composer, Blade templates, Vite + Tailwind, service providers, routing, testing, troubleshooting, WordPress Composer packages
- **Acorn** — routes, livewire, eloquent, middleware, queues, logging, commands, redis
- **WordPress** — native blocks, capabilities, WP-CLI, hooks lifecycle, performance, PHPStan, REST API, security

## Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sage-architect` | Analyze requirements and produce Architecture Decision Records |
| `sage-reviewer` | Audit code against Sage/Acorn conventions |
| `sage-debugger` | Systematic diagnostics for Sage/Acorn/Lando issues |
| `content-modeler` | Classify content as static, dynamic CPT, Options Page, or relational |
| `visual-verifier` | Compare implementation screenshots against design reference |
| `pencil-extractor` | Extract design specs and component maps from Pencil `.pen` files |

## Hooks

Zero-token automation that runs without consuming LLM context:

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **session-start** | Every session | Health check, detect design tools, inject ecosystem guide |
| **post-edit** | After Write/Edit | `lando flush` for PHP files, `lando theme-build` for assets |
| **post-compact** | Context compression | Re-inject active plan path and asset count |
| **pre-commit** | Before `git commit` | Remind to verify visually against design reference |
| **post-subagent** | Subagent completes | Log activity to plan directory |
| **post-stop** | Session ends | Log session end to plan directory |

### Hook warnings and diagnostics

If a hook does not appear to execute, run this checklist:

**1. Quick diagnostics**

```bash
bash scripts/doctor-hooks.sh
```

This verifies prerequisites (Lando, Node, hook scripts), active plans, and shows recent log entries.

**2. Enable debug logging**

```bash
export SUPERPOWERS_SAGE_HOOK_DEBUG=1
export SUPERPOWERS_SAGE_HOOK_LOG=.superpowers-sage/hooks.log
```

Then reproduce the action (edit a file, git commit, etc.) and inspect the log:

```bash
tail -20 .superpowers-sage/hooks.log
```

Look for entries with `HOOK_STATUS=skip` or `HOOK_STATUS=warn`.

**3. Common warnings**

| Warning | Cause | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `skip: lando CLI not found in PATH` | Lando not installed or not in PATH | Install Lando: `brew install lando` (macOS) or [platform-specific installer](https://lando.dev) |
| `skip: .lando.yml not found` | Project is not Lando-based | post-edit hook only runs in Lando projects |
| `skip: file_path not found in payload` | Hook couldn't extract file path from event | Normal for non-file actions; configure your editor to emit file paths on write |
| `skip: no active plan found` | No plan with `status: in-progress` exists | Create a plan with `/architecture-discovery` then `/plan-generator`, or run `/building` with an existing plan |
| `HOOK_STATUS=warn: theme-build failed` | Asset build error (Vite, Tailwind, etc.) | Run `lando theme-build` manually to see the full error |

## Command Discovery

Skills marked as `user-invocable: true` appear in the `/` command palette. They are displayed with their full technical name:

| Skill | Appears as | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `superpowers-sage:onboarding` | `/superpowers-sage:onboarding` or `/onboarding` | New to project or need overview |
| `superpowers-sage:architecture-discovery` | `/superpowers-sage:architecture-discovery` or `/architecture-discovery` | Discovering and validating architecture |
| `superpowers-sage:plan-generator` | `/superpowers-sage:plan-generator` or `/plan-generator` | Generating executable plan from approved spec |
| `superpowers-sage:architecting` | `/superpowers-sage:architecting` or `/architecting` | Compatibility alias for the two-step planning flow |
| `superpowers-sage:building` | `/superpowers-sage:building` or `/building` | Implementing from a plan |
| `superpowers-sage:designing` | `/superpowers-sage:designing` or `/designing` | Capturing design reference |
| `superpowers-sage:verifying` | `/superpowers-sage:verifying` or `/verifying` | Comparing vs design |
| `superpowers-sage:reviewing` | `/superpowers-sage:reviewing` or `/reviewing` | Auditing code/conventions |
| `superpowers-sage:modeling` | `/superpowers-sage:modeling` or `/modeling` | Content structure decisions |
| `superpowers-sage:debugging` | `/superpowers-sage:debugging` or `/debugging` | Troubleshooting issues |
| `superpowers-sage:install-plugin` | `/superpowers-sage:install-plugin` or `/install-plugin` | Installing WP plugins via Composer |

**Note:** If you don't see the expected command, refresh the plugin cache or restart your session. The `/` palette respects your editor's auto-complete configuration.

## Plan System

`/architecture-discovery` writes an approved spec in `docs/superpowers/specs/`, and `/plan-generator` generates plan directories that persist design context across sessions:

```
docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>/
  plan.md              # Status, strategy, design tool, component list
  architecture.md      # Architecture Decision Record
  content-model.md     # Static vs dynamic classification per component
  assets/              # Design reference images (screenshots, exports)
  components/          # Sub-plans per component
  logs/                # Activity tracking (auto-populated by hooks)
```

Plans survive context compression because hooks re-inject the active plan path, and `/building` always re-reads assets from disk before each component.

## Architectural Preferences

The plugin enforces opinionated patterns for the Roots ecosystem:

| Scenario | Use | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Routes | Acorn Routes | `register_rest_route()` |
| Background tasks | Action Scheduler / Queue + Job | Raw cron, looping scripts |
| Global config | ACF Options Pages | `wp_options` directly |
| Business logic | Service class or Provider | Fat controllers |
| Interactive UI | Livewire | Heavy custom JS |
| Static UI | Blade Component | Shortcodes |
| Fields & Blocks | ACF Composer | ACF GUI |
| Content types | Poet (`config/poet.php`) | `register_post_type()` |
| Forms | Livewire + HTML Forms | CF7, Gravity |
